# ## Generative Model
# This will require implementing a simple MLP neural network
# See example_flux_model.jl for inspiration
# Further, you should read the Basics section of the Flux.jl documentation
# https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/models/basics/
# that goes over the simple functions you will use.
# You will see that there's nothing magical going on inside these neural network libraries
# and when you implemented a neural network in previous assignments you did most of the work.
# If you want more information about how to use the functions from Flux, you can always reference
# the internal docs for each function by typing `?` into the REPL:
